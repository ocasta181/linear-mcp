# Linear MCP Server

An MCP server for interacting with Linear's API. This server provides a set of tools for managing Linear issues, projects, and teams through Cline.

## Setup Guide

### 1. Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

### 2. Authentication

The server supports two authentication methods:

#### API Key (Recommended)

1. Go to Linear Settings
2. Navigate to the "Security & access" section
3. Find the "Personal API keys" section
4. Click "New API key"
5. Give the key a descriptive label (e.g. "Cline MCP")
6. Copy the generated token immediately
7. Add the token to your `.env` file:
   ```
   LINEAR_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```

#### OAuth Flow (Experimental)

1. Create an OAuth application at https://linear.app/settings/api/applications
2. Configure OAuth environment variables in `.env`:
   ```
   LINEAR_CLIENT_ID=your_oauth_client_id
   LINEAR_CLIENT_SECRET=your_oauth_client_secret
   LINEAR_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/callback
   ```
3. Call `linear_auth` with `clientId`, `clientSecret`, and `redirectUri`, then
   open the returned authorization URL in your browser.
4. Pass both `code` and `state` from the redirect URL to `linear_auth_callback`
   in the same running MCP server. State expires after ten minutes and can only
   be used once. Starting another authorization attempt invalidates the previous
   URL. Missing, mismatched, expired, or reused state is rejected before any token
   exchange. After a failed exchange, start a new authorization attempt.

The MCP server does not run an HTTP callback listener. For local browser-based
testing with a listener on port 3000, use `npm run get-test-tokens`; it generates
and validates state in the same process. Tokens are held in memory, so restarting
the server requires authentication again. Live OAuth provider compatibility still
requires validation with your own Linear application.

### 3. Running the Server

1. Build the server:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### 4. Cline Integration

1. Open your Cline MCP settings file:
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`
   - Linux: `~/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`

2. Add the Linear MCP server configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "linear": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/path/to/linear-mcp/build/index.js"],
         "env": {
           "LINEAR_API_KEY": "your_personal_access_token"
         },
         "disabled": false,
         "autoApprove": []
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Available Actions

The server currently supports the following operations:

### Issue Management
- ✅ Create issues with full field support (title, description, team, project, etc.)
- ✅ Update existing issues (priority, description, etc.)
- ✅ Delete issues (single or bulk deletion)
- ✅ Search issues with filtering
- ✅ Associate issues with projects
- ✅ Create parent/child issue relationships
- ✅ Read and create comments and threaded comments

### Project Management
- ✅ Create projects with associated issues
- ✅ Get project information **with rich text descriptions**
- ✅ Search projects **with rich text descriptions**
- ✅ Associate issues with projects
- ✅ Proper description handling using Linear's `documentContent` field

### Team Management
- ✅ Get team information (with states and workflow details)
- ✅ Access team states and labels

### Authentication
- ✅ API Key authentication
- ✅ Secure token storage

### Batch Operations
- ✅ Bulk issue creation
- ✅ Bulk issue deletion

### Bulk Updates (In Testing)
- 🚧 Bulk issue updates (parallel processing implemented, needs testing)

## Rich Text Description Support

The server now properly handles Linear's rich text descriptions for projects:

- **Legacy Support**: Maintains compatibility with the old `description` field
- **Rich Content**: Uses Linear's `documentContent` field for actual description content
- **Automatic Fallback**: Falls back to legacy field if rich content is unavailable
- **Type Safety**: Includes proper TypeScript types for both description formats

### How It Works

Linear uses a dual-field system for descriptions:
1. `description` - Legacy field (often empty for backward compatibility)
2. `documentContent.content` - Contains the actual rich text description content

The MCP server automatically:
- Queries both fields from Linear's API
- Prioritizes `documentContent.content` over the legacy `description` field
- Provides a utility function `getProjectDescription()` for consistent access
- Returns an `actualDescription` field in responses for easy access

## Features in Development

The following features are currently being worked on:

### Issue Management
- 🚧 Complex search filters
- 🚧 Pagination support for large result sets

### Metadata Operations
- 🚧 Label management (create/update/assign)
- 🚧 Cycle/milestone management

### Project Management
- 🚧 Project template support
- 🚧 Advanced project operations

### Authentication
- 🚧 OAuth flow with automatic token refresh

### Performance & Security
- 🚧 Rate limiting
- 🚧 Detailed logging
- 🚧 Load testing and optimization

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Run integration tests (requires LINEAR_API_KEY)
npm run test:integration

# Build the server
npm run build

# Start the server
npm start
```

## Integration Testing

Integration tests verify that authentication and API calls work correctly:

1. Set up authentication (API Key recommended for testing)
2. Run integration tests:
   ```bash
   npm run test:integration
   ```

For OAuth testing:
1. Configure OAuth credentials in `.env`
2. Run `npm run get-test-tokens` to complete a browser authorization in one process
3. Optionally set `LINEAR_REFRESH_TOKEN` to exercise the live token refresh test
4. Run integration tests; tests requiring missing credentials are skipped

Run `npm run test:oauth:stdio` for credential-free OAuth and API key regression
checks over MCP stdio using mocked Linear HTTP responses.
